# Image Captioning

## Project Overview
In this work we have to combine Deep Convolutional Nets for image classification  with Recurrent Networks for sequence modeling, to create a single network that generates descriptions of image using [COCO Dataset - Common Objects in Context](http://cocodataset.org/).

COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation. GPU Accelerated Computing (CUDA) is neccessery for this project.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

__Notebook 0__ : Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset;

__Notebook 1__ : Load and pre-process data from the COCO dataset;

__Notebook 2__ : Training the CNN-RNN Model;

__Notebook 3__ : Load trained model and generate predictions.

## Installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nalbert9/Image-Captioning.git
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference
Following are a few results obtained after training the model for 3 epochs.

Image | Caption 
--- | --- 
<img src="images/Surf.png" width="200"> | **Generated Caption:** a person riding a surf board on a wave
<img src="images/motorcycle.png" width="200"> | **Generated Caption:** a group of people riding motorcycles down a street
<img src="images/boy.png" width="200">  | **Generated Caption:** a young boy brushing his teeth with a toothbrush
<img src="images/vase.png" width="200"> | **Generated Caption:** a vase with a flower on a table
